										<h2 class="major">A little about me</h2>
										<p>A passionate developer of all things cybersecurity and infosecurity. I double as the CEO and founder of Hello Security LLC, a remote/hybrid vCISO and consultancy agency. I have spent the last decade and a half in the fields of cybersecurity, infosecurity, and development. Experiencing all facets of the SMB, Enterpise, and even fortune 2000 cybersecurity markets. Iâ€™ve worked at, or collaborated with in the past, companies such as Tesla, Sinespace, LindenLab, ReforgedGames, and more. <br>
<br>
										I live, eat and breathe all things cybersecurity. I don't think a day has gone by in almost two decades wherein I wasn't attempting to learn a new skill or better understand the current overall cybersecurity landscape. Since an early age, I just knew, this is what I wanted to do with my life. Through all these years, there has been hard days and doubt on some occassions, but the passion and love for this field never dwindled through the bad times and glowed like a beacon in the distance during the good times. I couldnt imagine a life doing anything else.</p>

											<h3 class="major">BlockerBoy</h3>
											<p>BlockerBoy is an adaptive custom NIDS (network intrusion detection system) & malicious network traffic blocker created from scratch using python. I developed it during an active attack, real-time, during the attack, in order to mitigate malicious DD0S activities.</p>

											<h3 class="major">AutoAudit</h3>
											<p>AutoAudit is an automated security audit tool designed for SMB and enterprise organizations. It is built with Python and incorporates popular security tools such as Nmap, OpenVAS, and ZAP to perform vulnerability assessments, risk assessments, and compliance audits. AutoAudit generates comprehensive HTML reports and can be scheduled to run at regular intervals. The tool can also send email notifications with the latest audit reports. I developed AutoAudit to save an organization time and money as well as to ease the workload of security engineers in the SMB and Enterprise markets.</p>

											<h3 class="major">ICSZeroTrustAudit</h3>
											<p>I developed ICSZeroTrustAudit to perform an automated security audit on a target Industrial Control System (ICS). It includes multiple tests and checks, such as vulnerability scanning, network traffic analysis, credential checking, firewall and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) testing, and ICS-specific protocol testing (Modbus, DNP3, and IEC 60870-5-104). Additionally, it performs a compliance check based on Zero Trust principles. </p>

											<h3 class="major">IOCM8</h3>
											<p>IOCM8 scans a windows system for known IOC (indicators of compromise) outlined within the script. IOCM8 defines a list of known IOCs and then iterates through each IOC to check if it is present on the system. If the IOC is present, the script prints information about the IOC, such as its properties, network connections, or DNS queries, provides remediation instructions, and helpful resources from reputable security resources. I developed IOCM8 to help engineers keep their machines clean as well as hold the ability to remain on the cutting edge of emerging threats.</p>
